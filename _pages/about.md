Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Applied Mathematics Department at the University of Washington advised by [Tom Trogdon](https://faculty.washington.edu/trogdon/). I am broadly interested in numerical analysis, Riemann-Hilbert problems, PDEs, approximation theory, and spectral methods. 

Specifically, I am developing a unified methodology integrating spectral theory, Riemann-Hilbert problems, and inverse scattering theory to efficiently derive, and numerically implement, transform pairs associated to time-evolution variable-coefficient PDEs. In particular, the approach combines analytical formulae with numerical ODE and Riemann-Hilbert methods to efficiently evaluate the forward and inverse transforms, giving a hybrid analytical-numerical method for such PDEs.  The method has so far been demonstrated on transforms arising in the solution of the time-dependent Schr”ßdinger and Dirac equations, producing an accurate and stable time evolution method that does not require time stepping.

Previously, I did a dual BS at University of Maryland, Baltimore County in Mathematics and Physics.
